# sonus-auris organization context

This special public `.github` repository is the discoverable organization anchor for humans and AI agents.

- `profile/README.md` is the visible organization profile.
- `project-context.yaml` is the generated GitHub owner ↔ Linear project mapping.
- `org-context-manifest.json` records deterministic SHA-256 hashes for every other managed file.
- `agents/org-context.agent.md` is the organization-level GitHub Copilot custom-agent profile.
- `.github/workflows/org-context-integrity.yml` verifies this mirror against its immutable central registry commit.
- The generated profile and custom agent carry the mandatory semantic Git conflict-resolution policy.

The source of truth is the reviewed central registry named in `project-context.yaml`. Generated files should not be edited independently. Keep this repository public-safe.
